Have you ever wondered why modern fighter jets are slower than those from 1960 s? Let me explain, modern fighter jets are slower due to the growing emphasis on stealth capabilities. Modern jets are designed to be largely invisible to radar, requiring them to fly slower because of the aircraft body heating up which in turn damages its radar absorbing coatings as well as making it easier for infrared sensors to detect the aircraft. In addition, modern fighter jets most times do not fly supersonic because flying supersonic also consumes a lot of fuel, therefore reducing the aircraft range resulting in increased operation costs. However, this is why the F-22 Raptor cruising speed was reduced due to the aircraft was designed to ensure a safe and reliable air superiority platform.
